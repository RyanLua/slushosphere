# Slushosphere

Slushosphere is a project to make slushies in the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere) via high-altitude-balloons (HAB) and record the altitude in which water becomes a slushie. When water is exposed to low pressure, it boils at a lower temperature. At the same time, it freezes because of the cold temperatures in the stratosphere. We predict because of this, water will turn into a slush in the stratosphere.

How we will achieve this is using an Arduino with an environmental shield that has ambient temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors. A GPS shield will be used to record the location and altitude of the balloon along with time. A connector carrier to connect a submersible temperature sensor to measure the temperature of the water. A microSD card on the environmental shield to record all the data and a battery connected to the Arduino to power it all.

This project is a part of [Apex Hacks 2025](https://apex.hackclub.com) from [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com). Apex has provided us with the resources to make this project a reality including funding, travel and lodging, and a team of event organizers to help us along the way.

## Code

You can use either [Arduino IDE 2](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide/#ide-v2) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with [arduino-cli](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli) to upload the code to the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010.

## Materials

We can see the [Bill of Materials](Bill%20of%20Materials.csv) we used to make this project. It will contain the manufacturer and Amazon links for you to buy the materials. The total cost of the materials is under 400 USD.

All electronic materials have been checked to operate as low as -20Â°C. You can see the [Datasheet](Datasheet.md) for each electronic's official datasheet with operating temperatures.

### Student discounts

Discounts you can use if you are a student and doing this project.

- [Ardiuno offers 25% off the Ardiuno MKR Family and more](https://www.arduino.cc/education/github-students)
  - Helpful if you are only buying [Arduino MKR WiFi 1010](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mkr-wifi-1010). We are not using this because is cheaper to buy the [Arduino Environmental Monitor Bundle](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/environmental-monitor-bundle) rather than individually with the discount.
- [Adafruit offers discounts on certain Adafruit products](https://www.adafruit.com/github-students)
  - None of the discounts are for our parts so we cannot use it.
- [Amazon has Prime Student membership which is cheaper than Prime](https://www.amazon.com/joinstudent)
  - If you want faster and free delivery and exclusive Prime discounts. They were no exclusive Prime discounts for our materials at the time of the project.

## Notes

### Altitude tracking

If you're using a different GPS, make sure it works over 60,000 ft since most do not.

If you're using a barometer to get pressure and derive altitude from it, make sure records as low as 10 hPa or you may get inaccurate altitude. Most barometers don't measure that low.
